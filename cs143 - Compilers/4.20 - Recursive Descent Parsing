Lecture Title: Recursive Descent Parsing

Summary:
In this lecture, we discuss the basics of recursive descent parsing, a top-down parsing strategy that uses 
backtracking to construct a parse tree from a given input. We cover how to write recursive descent parsers by hand, 
eliminate left recursion in a grammar, and how this approach compares to other parsing techniques.

Detailed Bullet Points:

- Introduction to Recursive Descent Parsing
   - Top-down parsing strategy: Starts from the start symbol and tries to rewrite it to match the input string
   - Constructs parse tree from input by applying grammar rules
   - Backtracking: If a rule doesn't lead to a correct parse tree, it backtracks and tries another rule
   - Example: Arithmetic expressions with addition and multiplication

- Writing Recursive Descent Parsers by Hand
   - Create functions for each non-terminal in the grammar
   - Functions call each other recursively based on grammar rules
   - Match terminals directly in the input stream
   - Backtracking implemented by trying alternative rules when a rule doesn't match
   - Example: Writing a parser for arithmetic expressions with addition, multiplication, and parentheses

- Limitations of Recursive Descent Parsing
   - Left recursion in grammar causes infinite looping: The parser keeps calling itself with no progress
   - Example of left recursion: Grammar S → Sα | β
   - Solution: Eliminate left recursion in grammar to prevent infinite loops

- Eliminating Left Recursion
   - Convert left-recursive grammar to right recursion
   - Example: Transforming grammar S → Sα | β to S → βS' and S' → αS' | ε
   - General rule for eliminating left recursion in a grammar
   - Handling more complex cases with the Dragon Book: Provides a detailed algorithm for eliminating left recursion in any context-free grammar

- Recursive Descent in Practice
   - Hand-written parsers give control over error handling and allow handling of special cases
   - Parser generator tools can eliminate left recursion and resolve ambiguity automatically
   - Backtracking was considered too slow in the past, but modern machines and simpler grammars have made it more efficient
   - Restricting grammar can reduce the amount of backtracking required, improving performance

- Predictive Parsers
   - Look at tokens ahead in the input to avoid backtracking by making the right decision based on the next token
   - Will be covered in the next lecture: Introduces algorithms for constructing parsing tables to implement predictive parsing
