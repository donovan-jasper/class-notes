Title: Precedence and Associativity in Parsing

Summary:
This lecture explores the concepts of precedence and associativity in parsing, and how they affect grammar. 
It also introduces the use of tools such as Bison to manage these concepts in the parsing process. 
Furthermore, the lecture briefly touches upon unmatched analysis and error handling in parsing.

Bullet Point Notes:

- Ambiguity in grammar
  - Parsing needs to resolve ambiguities in grammar to construct the correct parse tree
  - Example: "2 + 3 * 4" has two possible parse trees with different interpretations

- Precedence
  - Precedence defines the order in which operators should be evaluated
  - Example: In arithmetic, multiplication has higher precedence than addition

- Associativity
  - Associativity defines the order in which operators with the same precedence should be evaluated
  - Example: In arithmetic, addition is left-associative, meaning "1 + 2 + 3" is evaluated as "(1 + 2) + 3"

- Stratified grammar
  - An approach to enforce precedence by rewriting the grammar into layers
  - Example: Separate addition and multiplication expressions into different layers in the grammar

- Bison tool
  - Bison is a parser generator that can help manage precedence and associativity
  - Example: Use Bison to declare precedence and associativity rules for addition and multiplication

- Precedence and associativity in Bison
  - Declare precedence and associativity rules in Bison using specific notations
  - Example: Declare addition and multiplication as left-associative and enforce their precedence order

- Unmatched analysis
  - A more involved topic that deals with unmatched constructs in grammar
  - Example: Dangling "if-else" statements and "if" statements without corresponding "else"

- Upcoming topics
  - Error handling and recursive descent parsing in the next lecture
  - Table-driven parsing algorithms in the following week
