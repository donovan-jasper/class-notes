Precedence:

  The precedence of infix binary and prefix unary operations, from highest to lowest, is given by the
  following table:
    .
    @
    ~
    isvoid
    * /
    + -
    <= < =
    not
    <-
  All binary operations are left-associative, with the exception of assignment, which is right-associative,
  and the three comparison operations, which do not associate.
  
  
AST:
  For each phylum named X there is a phylum called Xs (except for Classes, which is a list of Class
  nodes) of type List[X]. List functions are defined automatically for each list. For the Class phylum
  some of the list functions and methods are:
    Classes nil_Classes();
    Classes single_Classes(Class_);
    Classes append_Classes(Classes,Classes);
    Class_ nth(int index);
    int len();

The class constructor returns an AST of type (or phylum) Class . In cool.y there is the following
example of a use of the class constructor:
  class : CLASS TYPEID INHERITS TYPEID IS optional_feature_list END ’;’
  { $$ = class_($2,$4,$6,stringtable.add_string(curr_filename)); }
